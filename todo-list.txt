-implement the predetermined Riemann sum options
  -think of Riemann sum classes
  -unit testing
  -don't graph them, just show the function, the integral
  (range), and the result
  -can switch the version of the Riemann sum used to calculate
-implement line graph with user input?
-CSS; beautiful webpage/site

General Overview/Ideas
----------------------

-test each result with unit test
-main menu has options:
  -Riemann sum for predetermined, typical function
  -Riemann sum for parametric function (vector field)
  -Riemann sum between two functions
  -Riemann sum for line graph whose points are somehow received from the user
  (e.g. read from a text file somehow)
-within each sum, option to switch the version of the Riemann sum used
