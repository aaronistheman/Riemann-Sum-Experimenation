Todo
----

-linear function
  -implement both left and right
  -can switch version of the Riemann sum used (left or right)
-catch up readme
-other Riemann sum options
-implement line graph with user input?
-CSS; beautiful webpage/site

Considerable
------------

-graph the functions, or at least the non-parametric ones
-multiple functions within each option (e.g. multiple linear functions)
-double and/or triple integrals
-option to change number of rectangles used

General Overview/Ideas
----------------------

-test each result with unit test
-main menu has options:
  -Riemann sum for predetermined, typical function
    -y = mx + b: y = 2x + 3 on range [-5, 5]
  -Riemann sum for parametric function (vector field)
  -Riemann sum between two functions
  -Riemann sum for line graph whose points are somehow received from the user
  (e.g. read from a text file somehow)
-within each sum, option to switch the version of the Riemann sum used
-don't graph them, just show the function, the integral
  (range), and the result
  -can switch the version of the Riemann sum used to calculate
