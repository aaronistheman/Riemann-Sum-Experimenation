# Riemann-Sum-Experimenation

About
-----

This is a program that calculates Riemann sums for (selected) functions.
It's an experiment for my Supply Demand Graph Drawer project.

I programmed it in June 2016 (during the end of my first year in college,
although this isn't a college project)
with JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, HTML, and QUnit (for unit testing).

Features
--------

The user can choose to see the left and right Riemann sums of:
 1) a linear function,
 2) a quadratic function,
 3) a velocity vector function (to obtain arc length),
 4) the difference between two functions

Releases
